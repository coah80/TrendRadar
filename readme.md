## ✨ Core Features

### **Aggregates trending topics from across the web**

- Zhihu
- Douyin (TikTok China)
- bilibili trending
- WallstreetCN
- Tieba
- Baidu Hot Searches
- China News Service (CLS)
- The Paper (Pengpai)
- Phoenix News
- Toutiao
- Weibo

By default, TrendRadar monitors 11 mainstream platforms. You can also add additional platforms.

<details id="custom-platforms">
<summary><strong>👉 Click to expand: Custom platforms</strong></summary>
<br>

This project's news data is fetched via the newsnow project: https://github.com/ourongxing/newsnow. You can visit their site (https://newsnow.busiyi.world/) and click "More" to see if the platform you need is available.

To add platforms manually, see the source code at https://github.com/ourongxing/newsnow/tree/main/server/sources and then edit the `platforms` section in `config/config.yaml` to match the file names. For example:

```yaml
platforms:
  - id: "toutiao"
    name: "今日头条"
  - id: "baidu"  
    name: "百度热搜"
  - id: "wallstreetcn-hot"
    name: "华尔街见闻"
  # Add more platforms...
```

If that seems complex, you can copy curated platform lists shared by others: https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar/issues/95

</details>

### **Smart push strategies**

Three push modes:

| Mode | Best for | When it pushes | What is delivered | Typical use case |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Daily summary** (`daily`) | Managers / general users | Scheduled pushes (default: once per hour) | All matched news for the day + a "new items" section | Daily summaries; comprehensive day overview |
| **Current leaderboard** (`current`) | Content creators / media | Scheduled pushes (default: once per hour) | Matches from the current leaderboards + new items section | Real-time hotspot tracking; spot what's trending now |
| **Incremental monitoring** (`incremental`) | Investors / traders | Only when there are new matches | Newly appeared news containing matched frequency words | Avoid duplicate notifications; high-frequency monitoring |

Optional: push time window control (can be combined with any mode):

- Time window limits: set a time range for pushes (e.g., 09:00-18:00 or 20:00-22:00)
- Push frequency control:
  - Multiple pushes within the window: send a push each execution while in the window
  - Once per day: only send one push while inside the window (good for daily summary or current leaderboard)
- Example scenarios:
  - Push only during work hours 09:00-18:00
  - Receive a consolidated summary at night (e.g., 20:00-22:00)
  - Avoid being disturbed outside working hours

Tip: this feature is disabled by default. Enable it by setting `push_window.enabled` in `config/config.yaml`.

### **Precise content filtering**

Define personal keywords (for example: AI, BYD, education policy) to only receive related hot topics and filter out irrelevant content.

- Supports three syntaxes: plain words, required terms with `+`, and exclusion with `!` — see the frequency_words.txt configuration guide.
- Group management: treat different keyword groups separately and count matches independently.

> You can also choose to not filter and receive all hotspots. See the changelog entry for v2.0.1 for more details.

<details id="frequencywordstxt-configuration-guide">
<summary><strong>👉 Click to expand: frequency_words.txt configuration guide</strong></summary>
<br>

Configure monitoring keywords in `frequency_words.txt`. The file supports three syntaxes and grouping.

Keywords listed earlier have higher priority — you can reorder them to reflect importance.

| Syntax | Symbol | Purpose | Example | Matching rule |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Plain word | (none) | Basic match | `Huawei` | Match if any word appears |
| Required word | `+` | Narrow scope | `+phone` | Must be present in addition to plain keywords |
| Exclusion | `!` | Exclude noise | `!ad` | If present, exclude the item |

### Basic syntax

#### 1. Plain keywords
```txt
Huawei
OPPO
Apple
```
Matches if the title contains any one of these words.

#### 2. Required words `+word`
```txt
Huawei
OPPO
+phone
```
Matches only if both a plain keyword and the required word appear.

#### 3. Exclusion `!word`
```txt
Apple
Huawei
!fruit
!price
```
If a filtered word appears, the news is excluded even if it contains a keyword.

### Grouping — separate groups with blank lines

Core rule: Use a blank line to separate keyword groups. Each group is counted independently.

Example configuration:

```txt
iPhone
Huawei
OPPO
+release

A-shares
Shanghai
Shenzhen
+rise-fall
!prediction

World Cup
Euro Cup
Asia Cup
+match
```

Group explanations and matching behavior:

Group 1 — phone releases:
- Keywords: iPhone, Huawei, OPPO
- Required: release
- Effect: title must contain a phone brand and the word "release"

Matching examples:
- ✅ "iPhone 15 officially released with pricing announced" ← contains iPhone + release
- ✅ "Huawei Mate60 series release livestream" ← contains Huawei + release
- ✅ "OPPO Find X7 release date confirmed" ← contains OPPO + release
- ❌ "iPhone sales hit a record high" ← contains iPhone but lacks release

Group 2 — stock market:
- Keywords: A-shares, Shanghai, Shenzhen
- Required: rise-fall
- Exclusion: prediction
- Effect: must contain a stock term and the required word, but exclude items with "prediction"

Matching examples:
- ✅ "A-shares see major rise-fall today" ← contains A-shares + rise-fall
- ✅ "Shanghai index rise-fall analysis" ← contains Shanghai + rise-fall
- ❌ "Expert prediction of A-shares trend" ← contains A-shares + rise-fall but includes prediction
- ❌ "A-shares trading volume hits new high" ← lacks rise-fall

Group 3 — football matches:
- Keywords: World Cup, Euro Cup, Asia Cup
- Required: match
- Effect: must contain a cup name and the word "match"

Matching examples:
- ✅ "World Cup group stage match results" ← contains World Cup + match
- ✅ "Euro Cup final match schedule" ← contains Euro Cup + match
- ❌ "World Cup tickets on sale" ← lacks match

### Tips

1. Start broad, then narrow:
```txt
# Step 1: wide keywords for testing
AI
Artificial Intelligence
ChatGPT

# Step 2: narrow after noticing noise
AI
Artificial Intelligence
ChatGPT
+technology

# Step 3: add exclusions for noisy categories
AI
Artificial Intelligence
ChatGPT
+technology
!ads
!training
```

2. Avoid overly large single groups — split into focused groups for better precision.

### **Hot topic trend analysis**

Track how news popularity changes over time — understand not only what is trending but how a topic evolves.

- Timeline tracking: record each news item's full lifespan from first seen to last seen
- Popularity changes: compute rank and frequency changes over time
- New item detection: label newly detected trending topics with 🆕 for immediate attention
- Persistence analysis: distinguish one-off trending items from long-developing stories
- Cross-platform comparison: see how the same news ranks differently across platforms

> Never miss a news topic's full lifecycle; follow a story from its emergence to peak discussion.

| New items area | 🆕 **New items** | Consolidated new topics | Lists newly discovered items this run |

</details>


### **Personalized hotness algorithm**

TrendRadar reorders cross-platform trending items using a custom weighting algorithm rather than relying on any single platform's ranking:

- Rank importance (60% by default): items with high rank on platforms weigh more
- Frequency (30%): items that appear repeatedly across grabs weigh more
- Rank quality (10%): considers both frequency and high placement

> The combined ranking can be adjusted to suit different use cases.

<details>
<summary><strong>👉 Click to expand: weight adjustment</strong></summary>
<br>

Default config is balanced. Two sample scenarios:

Realtime hotspot focus:
```yaml
weight:
  rank_weight: 0.8    # prioritize rank
  frequency_weight: 0.1
  hotness_weight: 0.1
```
Best for content creators and marketers who want the currently hottest topics.

Depth-topic focus:
```yaml
weight:
  rank_weight: 0.4
  frequency_weight: 0.5  # emphasize persistence
  hotness_weight: 0.1
```
Best for investors, researchers, and journalists who need deeper trend analysis.

Adjustment rules:
1. The three numbers must sum to 1.0
2. Increase the factor that matters more to you
3. Change gradually (0.1-0.2) and observe results

</details>


### **Multi-channel real-time pushing**

Supports enterprise WeChat, Feishu, DingTalk, Telegram, Email, and ntfy. Notifications reach phones and inboxes.

### **Multi-end support**
- GitHub Pages: automatically generates a clean web report, responsive for PC/mobile
- Docker deployment: multi-architecture container support
- Data persistence: save history in HTML/TXT formats


### **AI Analysis (added in v3.0.0)**

An AI conversational analysis system based on the MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows deep exploration of news data using natural language.

- Conversational queries: ask in plain language, e.g., "Search yesterday's Zhihu trending topics", "Analyze recent Bitcoin popularity trends"
- 13 analysis tools: basic queries, intelligent search, trend analysis, data insights, sentiment analysis, etc.
- Multiple client support: Cherry Studio (GUI), Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and more
- Analysis features include:
  - Topic trend tracking (hotness changes, lifecycle, outbreak detection, trend prediction)
  - Cross-platform comparison (activity stats, keyword co-occurrence)
  - Smart summaries, similar-news search, historical relation retrieval

> Skip manual file inspection — let the AI assistant explain the story behind the news.

### Zero-technical barrier deployment

Fork on GitHub and use — no coding required.

> 30-second deploy: GitHub Pages (view the report and save as image to share)
>
> 1-minute deploy: Enterprise WeChat notifications

Tip: Want a real-time web report? After forking, go to your repo Settings → Pages and enable GitHub Pages. Preview: https://sansan0.github.io/TrendRadar/

### Reduce app dependency

Be proactive about the information you want, instead of relying on algorithmic recommendations.

Ideal for: investors, content creators, corporate PR, and users who follow current affairs.

Use cases: stock monitoring, brand public opinion tracking, industry updates, daily news tracking
